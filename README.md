# Code Platoon Curriculum 2017

## Welcome Message
Veterans, thank you for your service to our country. Code Platoon NFP's mission is to help bridge the gap between a  military career and the tech world by turning veterans into software developers in a condensed timeframe.
In this repository, you will find the curriculum for our first three weeks of class, including daily challenges and links to any necessary resources. (The lessons presume some preparatory study in Ruby, Javascript and algorithms. For most students, about 60 hours of study on www.codecademy.com or a similar site is sufficient.)
If you find our approach appealing and wish to continue your education with us,
please apply on [Code Platoon's website](http://www.codeplatoon.org/apply/) or email Rod at Rod@codeplatoon.org
